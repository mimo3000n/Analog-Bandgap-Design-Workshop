## Overview


Bandgap Voltage Reference (BGR) Design and Characterization is a hands-on workshop for mastering one of the most critical analog circuits. Built on industry-standard principles, you will work through the complete design flow: from architecture selection and component sizing to full-circuit simulation and verification. The curriculum emphasizes a deep understanding of BGR fundamentals, robust design techniques, and credible verification methods that meet international standards for research and product development.

 

You will begin at the component level with CTAT and PTAT voltage generation circuits, understanding the physics of bipolar transistors and the design of precision resistors. You will then construct and analyze a self-biased current mirror, tackling issues of supply independence and implementing a reliable start-up circuit. Each module includes practical calculations, pre-verified netlist templates, and measurement scripts to ensure you focus on design intuition rather than tool debugging.

 

The program culminates in the integration of a complete BGR circuit. You will simulate and analyze the final output for temperature stability (tempco), line regulation (PSRR), and load regulation. Guided by detailed specifications, you will run deterministic PVT corners (Process, Voltage, Temperature) to sign-off on the design’s robustness. Graduates leave with a coherent portfolio: annotated schematics, simulation results, and a comprehensive engineering report that demonstrates readiness for analog and mixed-signal design roles.
